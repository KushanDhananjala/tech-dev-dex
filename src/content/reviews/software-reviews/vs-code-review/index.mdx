## Configuration and Customization

### Settings

VS Code is highly customizable through settings:

```json
{
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,
  "editor.wordWrap": "on",
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
  "files.autoSaveDelay": 1000,
  "editor.minimap.enabled": true,
  "editor.lineNumbers": "on"
}
```

### Themes

Popular themes include:
- **Dark+** (default dark)
- **Light+** (default light)
- **Monokai**
- **Solarized Dark**
- **Material Theme**

### Keybindings

VS Code supports custom keybindings:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+shift+p",
    "command": "workbench.action.showCommands"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+`",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal"
  }
]
```

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Performance

1. **Disable unused extensions**
2. **Use workspace-specific settings**
3. **Limit file watchers**
4. **Disable telemetry if not needed**
5. **Use .gitignore for large folders**
6. **Close unused tabs**
7. **Restart periodically**

### Memory Management

```json
{
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.git/objects/**": true,
    "**/.git/subtree-cache/**": true,
    "**/node_modules/**": true,
    "**/dist/**": true
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations
