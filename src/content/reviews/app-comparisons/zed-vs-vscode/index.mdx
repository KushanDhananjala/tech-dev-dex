## Performance
Zed’s native UI and Rust core deliver snappy interactions, especially on large files. VS Code’s performance is solid but can degrade with many extensions.

## Extensions & ecosystem
VS Code wins on breadth. Zed’s extension story is improving but not yet comparable. If you require niche tooling, VS Code is safer today.

## Collaboration
Zed’s real‑time collaboration is fast and feels seamless. VS Code’s Live Share is mature and widely adopted.

## Remote development
VS Code Remote and Codespaces are battle‑tested. Zed’s remote features are evolving quickly and are promising for 2025.

## Verdict
Pick Zed for speed and minimalism; pick VS Code for ecosystem depth. Many teams will use both depending on task.
