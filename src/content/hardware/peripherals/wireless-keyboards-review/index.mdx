# Best Wireless Keyboards for Developers

Wireless keyboards offer freedom from cables while maintaining the precision needed for programming. Modern wireless keyboards provide low latency, reliable connectivity, and long battery life, making them excellent choices for developers who value clean workspaces and portability.

## Wireless Connectivity Options

Understanding the different wireless technologies helps you choose the right keyboard for your needs:

### Bluetooth

Bluetooth keyboards connect directly to your device without a dongle. They're ideal for multi-device setups and work well with laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Bluetooth 5.0+ offers improved range and battery life.

### 2.4GHz Wireless

2.4GHz wireless keyboards use a USB dongle for connection. They typically offer lower latency than Bluetooth and more reliable connections, making them better for intensive typing and gaming.

### Dual Connectivity

Many premium keyboards offer both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity, giving you the flexibility to choose the best connection for your situation.
