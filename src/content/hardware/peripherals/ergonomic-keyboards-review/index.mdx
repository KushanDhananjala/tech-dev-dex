# Best Ergonomic Keyboards for Developers

Ergonomic keyboards are designed to reduce strain and improve comfort during long programming sessions. They feature split designs, tented layouts, and natural hand positioning to minimize repetitive strain injuries and improve typing comfort.

## Why Ergonomic Keyboards Matter

Long hours of programming can lead to:

- **Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI):** Carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis
- **Wrist Pain:** From awkward hand positioning
- **Shoulder Tension:** From reaching for keys
- **Neck Strain:** From looking down at the keyboard

Ergonomic keyboards address these issues through:

- **Natural Hand Position:** Reduces wrist extension and ulnar deviation
- **Split Design:** Allows shoulders to stay relaxed
- **Tented Layout:** Reduces pronation and supination
- **Adjustable Angles:** Customize for individual comfort

## Types of Ergonomic Keyboards

### Split Keyboards

Split keyboards separate the left and right halves, allowing natural shoulder width positioning:

- **Fully Split:** Two completely separate halves
- **Tented Split:** Angled halves for natural wrist position
- **Adjustable Split:** Customizable separation distance
- **Fixed Split:** Pre-set optimal separation

### Curved Keyboards

Curved keyboards follow the natural arc of your fingers:

- **Fixed Curve:** Pre-designed curve for most users
- **Adjustable Curve:** Customizable curve radius
- **Asymmetric Curve:** Different curves for each hand
- **Variable Curve:** Multiple curve options

### Tented Keyboards

Tented keyboards angle the keys toward your thumbs:

- **Fixed Tenting:** Pre-set optimal angle
- **Adjustable Tenting:** Customizable tenting angle
- **Negative Tenting:** Keys angled away from center
- **Positive Tenting:** Keys angled toward center
