# Kanban: Visual Workflow Management for Development Teams

Kanban is a visual workflow management method that helps teams optimize their work processes through continuous improvement. Originally developed by Toyota for manufacturing, Kanban has been successfully adapted for software development and knowledge work.

## What is Kanban?

Kanban is a method for managing and improving work across human systems. It focuses on:

- **Visualizing Work:** Making work visible through boards and cards
- **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP):** Constraining work to improve flow
- **Managing Flow:** Optimizing the movement of work through the system
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly improving processes and practices

### Core Kanban Principles

1. **Start with What You Do Now:** Begin with current processes
2. **Agree to Pursue Incremental Change:** Make small, continuous improvements
3. **Respect Current Roles and Responsibilities:** Work within existing structure
4. **Encourage Leadership at All Levels:** Everyone can contribute to improvement

## Kanban Board Structure

### Basic Board Layout

A typical Kanban board consists of columns representing different stages of work:

#### To Do
- **Purpose:** Work that needs to be started
- **Content:** User stories, tasks, bugs, features
- **Management:** Prioritized by value and urgency
- **WIP Limit:** Usually no limit (infinite capacity)

#### In Progress
- **Purpose:** Work currently being worked on
- **Content:** Active tasks and stories
- **Management:** Limited by WIP constraints
- **WIP Limit:** Based on team capacity

#### Done
- **Purpose:** Completed work ready for delivery
- **Content:** Finished stories and tasks
- **Management:** Ready for review or deployment
- **WIP Limit:** Usually no limit

### Advanced Board Layouts

#### Software Development Board
```
Backlog → Analysis → Development → Testing → Review → Done
```

#### Feature Development Board
```
Epic → Feature → Story → Development → Testing → Deploy → Done
```

#### Bug Fix Board
```
Bug Report → Triage → Fix → Test → Deploy → Done
```

## Work in Progress (WIP) Limits

### What are WIP Limits?

WIP limits are constraints on the number of items that can be in progress at any given time. They help:

- **Prevent Overload:** Avoid taking on too much work
- **Improve Focus:** Concentrate on fewer items
- **Reduce Context Switching:** Minimize task switching
- **Increase Throughput:** Complete work faster

### Setting WIP Limits

#### Team Capacity
- **Individual Capacity:** Based on team member availability
- **Skill Constraints:** Limited by specialized knowledge
- **Resource Availability:** Tools, equipment, and support
- **Historical Data:** Past performance and velocity

#### Common WIP Limit Strategies
- **Per Person:** 1-2 items per team member
- **Per Column:** Limit items in each workflow stage
- **Per Team:** Overall team capacity limit
- **Dynamic Limits:** Adjust based on conditions

### Benefits of WIP Limits

#### Improved Flow
- **Faster Completion:** Items move through system quicker
- **Reduced Blocking:** Fewer bottlenecks and delays
- **Better Predictability:** More consistent delivery
- **Higher Quality:** More time per item

#### Team Benefits
- **Reduced Stress:** Less pressure to multitask
- **Better Focus:** Concentration on current work
- **Improved Collaboration:** Team works together on fewer items
- **Skill Development:** Time to learn and improve

## Kanban Metrics and Measurement

### Key Metrics

#### Lead Time
- **Definition:** Time from work start to completion
- **Measurement:** Track from "In Progress" to "Done"
- **Purpose:** Measure customer value delivery speed
- **Improvement:** Reduce lead time through process optimization

#### Cycle Time
- **Definition:** Time spent actively working on an item
- **Measurement:** Track active work time only
- **Purpose:** Measure team efficiency
- **Improvement:** Optimize work processes

#### Throughput
- **Definition:** Number of items completed per time period
- **Measurement:** Count items moved to "Done"
- **Purpose:** Measure team productivity
- **Improvement:** Increase completion rate

#### Work in Progress
- **Definition:** Number of items currently in progress
- **Measurement:** Count items in "In Progress" columns
- **Purpose:** Monitor team capacity utilization
- **Improvement:** Optimize WIP levels

### Visual Metrics

#### Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)
- **Purpose:** Visualize work flow over time
- **Shows:** Work in each stage over time
- **Benefits:** Identify bottlenecks and trends
- **Usage:** Process improvement and planning

#### Lead Time Distribution
- **Purpose:** Understand completion time patterns
- **Shows:** Range and distribution of lead times
- **Benefits:** Predict delivery times
- **Usage:** Customer communication and planning

#### Burndown Charts
- **Purpose:** Track progress toward goals
- **Shows:** Work remaining over time
- **Benefits:** Monitor sprint or release progress
- **Usage:** Sprint planning and stakeholder updates
