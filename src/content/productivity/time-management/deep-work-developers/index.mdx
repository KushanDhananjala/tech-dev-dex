## Principles
Deep work requires intentional constraints: fewer context switches, explicit focus blocks, and clear outcome definitions before you start.

### Daily cadence
- Morning: 2× 60–90 minute focus blocks (hardest tasks first)
- Afternoon: shallow work, reviews, async communication windows
- Evening: plan tomorrow’s first focus block

### Environment design
- Single-monitor “focus scene” (hide chats, close tabs)
- Website blockers during focus blocks
- Notification batching (email/IM checks at set times)

### Team agreements
- Shared focus hours calendar
- Async-first updates; minimize meetings in focus windows
- Clear SLA for replies to avoid urgency creep

### Tooling
- Task manager with weekly goals tied to outcomes
- Calendar time-blocking with buffer zones
- Status automation (e.g., Slack Do Not Disturb during blocks)

### Measuring impact
- Track start/stop times, interruptions, and outcomes
- Weekly retro: reduce sources of unplanned work

## Templates
```
Focus Block
Goal: Implement X (definition of done)
Time: 09:00–10:30
Environment: No notifications, blockers enabled
Notes: …
```

## Conclusion
Consistency beats intensity. Protect your calendar, align with your team, and iterate.
