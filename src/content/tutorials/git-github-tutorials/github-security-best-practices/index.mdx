# GitHub Security: Best Practices and Hardening

GitHub security is crucial for protecting your code, data, and infrastructure. This comprehensive guide covers security best practices, access control, and threat mitigation.

## GitHub Security Fundamentals

### Security Layers

1. **Repository Security**: Code protection and access control
2. **Account Security**: User authentication and authorization
3. **Organization Security**: Team and enterprise controls
4. **Workflow Security**: CI/CD pipeline protection
5. **Dependency Security**: Third-party package management

## Repository Security

### Branch Protection Rules

```yaml
# Enable branch protection for main branch
# Repository Settings > Branches > Add rule

Required settings:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require linear history
- Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
```

### Code Scanning

```yaml
# .github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'javascript', 'python', 'java' ]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

### Dependency Scanning

```yaml
# .github/workflows/dependency-review.yml
name: 'Dependency Review'
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  dependency-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 'Checkout Repository'
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: 'Dependency Review'
        uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v3
```

## Access Control and Permissions

### Repository Access Levels

1. **Read**: View repository contents
2. **Triage**: Manage issues and pull requests
3. **Write**: Push to repository
4. **Maintain**: Manage repository settings
5. **Admin**: Full repository access

### Organization Security

```yaml
# Organization settings
Security settings:
- Require two-factor authentication
- Enable IP allow list
- Restrict repository creation
- Enable security advisories
- Configure audit logs
```

### Team Management

```bash
# Create teams with specific permissions
# Organization > Teams > New team

Team structure:
- Core Team: Admin access to critical repos
- Developers: Write access to development repos
- Reviewers: Triage access for code review
- Security Team: Admin access to security repos
```

## Secrets Management

### Repository Secrets

```yaml
# Store secrets in repository settings
# Repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions

Common secrets:
- API_KEYS: Third-party service keys
- DATABASE_URL: Database connection strings
- DEPLOY_TOKEN: Deployment authentication
- SLACK_WEBHOOK: Notification endpoints
```

### Environment Secrets

```yaml
# Create environments with protection rules
# Repository > Settings > Environments

Environment protection rules:
- Required reviewers
- Wait timer
- Deployment branches
- Environment secrets
```

### Secret Scanning

```yaml
# Enable secret scanning alerts
# Repository > Settings > Security > Code security and analysis

# Configure custom patterns
# Organization > Security > Secret scanning > Custom patterns
```

## Workflow Security

### Secure Workflow Practices

```yaml
# .github/workflows/secure-deploy.yml
name: Secure Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  security-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
    - name: Run security scan
      run: |
        npm audit --audit-level high
        npm run security:scan
        
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: security-check
    environment: production
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      env:
        DEPLOY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        echo "Deploying securely..."
```

### Workflow Permissions

```yaml
# Limit workflow permissions
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  security-events: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
    - name: Build application
      run: npm run build
```

### Third-Party Actions Security

```yaml
# Use specific action versions
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Specific version

# Pin to commit SHA for maximum security
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3@8c91899e8f2b8d25bc5d3b0e6c4b1c8b5e6f7a8b
```

## Dependency Security

### Dependabot Configuration

```yaml

    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "security-team"
    assignees:
      - "security-team"

  # Enable version updates for Docker
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"

  # Enable version updates for GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

### Security Advisories

```bash
# Create security advisory
# Repository > Security > Security advisories > New draft security advisory

# Report vulnerability
# Repository > Security > Security advisories > Report a vulnerability
```

### Package Security

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-audit.yml

  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Run npm audit
      run: |
        npm audit --audit-level moderate
        npm audit fix
        
    - name: Run Snyk security scan
      uses: snyk/actions/node@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```
