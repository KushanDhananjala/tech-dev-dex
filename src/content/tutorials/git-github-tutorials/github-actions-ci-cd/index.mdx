# GitHub Actions CI/CD: Complete Setup Guide

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform that automates your software development workflows. Learn how to set up automated testing, building, and deployment.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository.

### Key Features

- **Event-driven**: Trigger workflows on push, pull request, release, etc.
- **Matrix builds**: Test across multiple environments
- **Secrets management**: Secure handling of sensitive data
- **Marketplace**: Thousands of pre-built actions
- **Self-hosted runners**: Run workflows on your own infrastructure

## Getting Started

### Basic Workflow Structure

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
```

### Workflow Triggers

```yaml
# Multiple triggers
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths: [ 'src/**', 'package.json' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    types: [ opened, synchronize, reopened ]
  release:
    types: [ published ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
```

## Essential Actions

```

## Advanced Techniques

### Self-Hosted Runners

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Build on self-hosted runner
      run: npm run build
```

### Workflow Dependencies

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      image-tag: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
    steps:
    - name: Build image
      id: meta
      run: echo "image-tag=myapp:${{ github.sha }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
    - name: Deploy image
      run: echo "Deploying ${{ needs.build.outputs.image-tag }}"
```

### Reusable Workflows

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Application

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string
      image-tag:
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.environment }}
      run: echo "Deploying ${{ inputs.image-tag }} to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
      
  deploy:
    needs: test
    uses: ./.github/workflows/deploy.yml
    with:
      environment: production
      image-tag: myapp:${{ github.sha }}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Specific Action Versions

```yaml
# Good
- uses: actions/checkout@v3

# Bad
- uses: actions/checkout@master
```

### 2. Optimize Workflow Performance

```yaml
# Use concurrency to prevent duplicate runs
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### 3. Clean Up Resources

```yaml
- name: Cleanup
  if: always()
  run: |
    docker system prune -f
    rm -rf node_modules
```

### 4. Use Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  NODE_ENV: production
  DEBUG: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CUSTOM_VAR: value
    steps:
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
```

### 5. Implement Proper Error Handling

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  continue-on-error: true
  run: npm test

- name: Check test results
  if: steps.test.outcome == 'failure'
  run: echo "Tests failed but continuing..."
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Workflow Debugging

```yaml
- name: Debug information
  run: |
    echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
    echo "Ref: ${{ github.ref }}"
    echo "SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"
    echo "Actor: ${{ github.actor }}"
    echo "Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
```

### Artifact Management

```yaml
- name: Upload build artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: build-files
    path: dist/
    retention-days: 30

- name: Download artifacts
  uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: build-files
    path: dist/
```
