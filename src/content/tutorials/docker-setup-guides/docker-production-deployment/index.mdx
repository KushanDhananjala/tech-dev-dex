# Docker Production Deployment Guide

Deploying Docker containers to production requires careful planning, security considerations, and monitoring strategies. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know for production deployments.

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Security Considerations

- Use non-root users in containers
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Implement secrets management
- Configure proper networking
- Set up monitoring and logging

### Performance Optimization

- Resource limits and requests
- Health checks
- Auto-scaling policies
- Load balancing
- Caching strategies

## Container Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Minimal Base Images

```dockerfile
# Good: Use minimal base images
FROM alpine:3.18

# Bad: Avoid full OS images
FROM ubuntu:20.04
```

### 2. Run as Non-Root User

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# Switch to non-root user
USER nextjs

# Your application code
COPY --chown=nextjs:nodejs . .
```

### 3. Scan Images for Vulnerabilities

```bash
# Use Docker Scout
docker scout cves myapp:latest

# Use Trivy
trivy image myapp:latest
```

## Production Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.blue.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:blue
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

```yaml
# docker-compose.green.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:green
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
```

### Rolling Updates

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: myapp:latest
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
      update_config:
        parallelism: 1
        delay: 10s
        failure_action: rollback
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Health Checks

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

### Log Management

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"
```

## Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    deploy:
      replicas: 5
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
```

### Load Balancing

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

  web:
    build: .
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
```

## Conclusion

Production Docker deployment requires careful attention to security, performance, and monitoring. Follow these best practices to ensure reliable and secure containerized applications in production.
